The data set we will be utilizing comes from an online source of meteorological data collected in various areas around 
the globe over time (IEM :: Download ASOS/AWOS/METAR Data). The data set contains data points down to the minute, 
spanning from present day all the way back to the 1940s. To specify our data for the purposes of this project, we made 
data available for all 113 weather stations in the state of Florida for the past 15 years. This file contains well over 
the project-defined requirement of at least 100,000 data points and holds very important information as it demonstrates 
how weather patterns have changed in the state of Florida since 2010. 

Once the initial GUI has loaded, the user can type in the three-letter code of the weather station of their choice, as 
well as units, whether they would like to use a hashmap or map and the time span. 
Once they click "Go!", a timer starts running and the final time for each data structure is displayed. The dates and 
average temperatures for the selected timespan are also displayed in the console.
